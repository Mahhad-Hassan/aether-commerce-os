# Aether Commerce OS

Aether is a full-stack commerce operations workspace built as an alternative to traditional hosted store administration tools. It combines a React 19 storefront and administration experience with a TypeScript Express middleware layer for catalog, customers, orders, inventory, purchasing, payments, stores, and reporting.

The application is organized as a private npm workspace monorepo:

- `frontend/` is the browser application, built with Vite, TanStack Router, React Query, Zustand, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, Motion, and Recharts.
- `backend/` is the Express TypeScript API layer. It validates configuration, forwards authenticated requests to the configured business-data service, exposes commerce endpoints, and provides a controlled generic proxy.
- The root `package.json` supplies the workspace scripts and runs both applications together.

## Product Areas

The application covers the complete operating surface of a modern commerce business:

- Dashboard overview, analytics, revenue charts, traffic channels, and top-page reporting.
- Products, product variants, SKUs, categories, collections, pricing, tags, SEO fields, media, and stock tracking.
- Orders, draft orders, abandoned checkouts, payments, fulfillment, shipping status, refunds, returns, invoices, addresses, timelines, and customer records.
- Inventory by warehouse, low-stock monitoring, committed stock, inbound stock, damaged stock, returned stock, and warehouse availability.
- Purchase Orders with suppliers, line items, tax, discount, payment entries, balances, schedules, warehouses, attachments, activity, filtering, CSV/PDF export, printing, duplication, and detail views.
- Purchase Invoices with supplier bills, due dates, payment state, tax, discounts, outstanding balances, returns, debit notes, stock updates, purchase-order references, payment terms, attachments, activity, filtering, exports, printing, and detail views.
- Gift Cards, including listing, lookup, balance validation, and redemption-oriented API support.
- Online Store, storefront rendering, cart drawer, media selection, content sections, templates, template previews, template application, publishing, and a visual website builder.
- Growth, campaign management, attribution, marketing channels, and customer acquisition reporting.
- Store administration including store selection, multi-tenant data isolation, profile, workspace, security, notifications, inbox, billing, appearance, language and region, API keys, accessibility, and help center screens.

## Architecture

The browser communicates with the backend through `/api`. During development, Vite proxies that path to the Express server on port `5000`. The backend then calls the configured upstream business-data service using either a forwarded browser session cookie or configured service credentials.

```text
Browser
  |
  | React UI, TanStack Router, React Query, Zustand
  v
Vite development server :3000
  |
  | /api proxy
  v
Express middleware :5000
  |
  | typed controllers, validation, error handling, auth forwarding
  v
Configured upstream business-data service
```

### Data flow

1. Frontend API modules call the local `/api` client.
2. Express routes select a focused controller for products, inventory, purchasing, gift cards, or stores.
3. Controllers build filters, pagination, sorting, and request payloads.
4. The shared service applies authentication, forwards cookies when present, and performs resource or method requests.
5. Frontend mappers convert upstream records into stable product, category, inventory, order, purchase order, and purchase invoice models.
6. React Query hooks and Zustand stores make the data available to dashboard, builder, and storefront views.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20 or newer
- npm 10 or newer
- Access to the configured upstream business-data service for live records

## Installation

From the repository root:

```bash
npm install
```

The root workspace installs dependencies for both `frontend` and `backend`.

### Environment configuration

Create the local environment files from the checked-in examples and keep secrets out of Git:

```bash
Copy-Item backend/.env.example backend/.env
New-Item frontend/.env -ItemType File -Force
```

Configure the backend with its port, runtime mode, frontend origin, upstream base URL, and upstream authentication values. The supplied `backend/.env.example` is the authoritative list of required variable names. Configure `frontend/.env` with the backend URL, normally `http://localhost:5000`.

The default local ports are:

- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend health endpoint: `http://localhost:5000/health`

Environment files are ignored by Git. Never commit API keys, API secrets, cookies, or production URLs.

## Running the Application

From the root directory:

```bash
# Run frontend and backend together
npm run dev

# Run only the frontend
npm run dev:frontend

# Run only the backend
npm run dev:backend
```

The frontend also supports these workspace-local commands:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
npm run build:dev
npm run preview
npm run lint
npm run format
```

Backend commands:

```bash
cd backend
npm run build
npm start
npm run lint
```

Root production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Backend Module Catalog

### Entry point, configuration, and shared service

- `backend/src/server.ts` creates the Express server, configures CORS, JSON parsing, request logging, health reporting, API mounting, and the centralized error middleware.
- The backend upstream configuration module loads environment variables, defines the upstream base URL, and creates service authentication headers.
- The backend upstream service module owns the Axios client and supports resource listing, single-record reads, creates, updates, deletes, method calls, cookie forwarding, and arbitrary proxied requests.
- `backend/src/middlewares/error.middleware.ts` normalizes controller and upstream failures into consistent HTTP error responses.
- The backend shared upstream types module defines response, item, category, inventory, purchase, gift-card, and store data shapes.

## Business Workflow Notes

### Purchase Orders

Purchase Orders begin with supplier, warehouse, currency, order date, schedule date, and line items. Each line supports product/SKU, quantity, unit, cost, tax, discount, warehouse, scheduled receipt date, and received quantity. The store calculates subtotal, discount, tax, grand total, paid amount, and balance. Users can search and filter by supplier, status, date range, and amount, then inspect, edit, duplicate, delete, import, export, print, and record payment entries.

### Purchase Invoices

Purchase Invoices represent supplier bills and support company, supplier, bill number/date, posting date, due date, currency, payment terms, warehouse, taxes, discounts, net total, grand total, rounded total, paid amount, and outstanding amount. Lines retain product, SKU, description, quantity, unit, cost, discount, amount, warehouse, Purchase Order reference, Purchase Receipt reference, expense account, and cost center. The workflow includes draft/submitted/paid/partly-paid/unpaid/overdue/cancelled/return/debit-note states, payment records, stock updates, return references, detail pages, amendment, update, deletion, export, and printing.

### Storefront and tenant isolation

Store data is persisted per tenant. Authentication initialization switches the active tenant, and the same product, collection, cart, customer, and order models are shared by dashboard, builder, and published site views. This keeps administration and storefront behavior aligned while leaving the persistence boundary replaceable for future deployment architectures.

## API Summary

| Purchase Orders | List with filters and pagination; create |
| Purchase Invoices | List, read, create, update, amend, delete |
| Gift Cards | List, read, validate balances, and redemption-oriented access |
| Stores | Read current user and store/site data |
| Resource forwarding | Controlled arbitrary resource requests |
| Method forwarding | Controlled arbitrary method requests |
